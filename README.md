## Description

üîç The motivation for this project was to update my own personal portfolio webpage with all the skills I acquired so far. The reason for this is because to be able to sell myself to potential employers is to show them see what I can actually do with my skills and what I can provide to them. By using the new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don‚Äôt use the latest technologies. For this project I learn that to better improve myself I need to continuously learn all the new tips and knowledge that I can  implement in every project that I can get my hands on. With my projects i like to give them a more personal touch depending on each project that i work on.
